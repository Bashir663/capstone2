About me: 

I'm a college student on my way to becoming an all-around web developer. This a long and interesting road ahead with many different types of skills that need to be honed and i can't wait to become effecient and make impressive websites.
I love watching anime and playing video games. Music from both is awesome and I tend to stay away from social media since I believe it can never bring any productivity or joy to a person's life.
